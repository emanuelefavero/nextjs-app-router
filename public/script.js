console.log('Hello from script.js!')

// NOTE: The following code will work only on first page load. If you move between routes, the script will not be executed again. There are workaround for this but it is not worth it. Use the script this way only if really necessary. The Script feature in Next.js is better suited for external libraries and not for custom scripts
// const scriptPageTitle = document.getElementById('script-page-title')
// scriptPageTitle.style.color = '#14b8a6'
